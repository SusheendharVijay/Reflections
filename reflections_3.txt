When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when multiple people need to work in the project 
you can contribute from anyhwere
code is protected from loss due to hardware failure

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so you can control what is being added to your program, and you can choose when it gets updated too. maybe the work youre doing conflicts  the commits done online.
