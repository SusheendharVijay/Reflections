->when multiple people need to work in the project 
you can contribute from anyhwere
code is protected from loss due to hardware failure

->Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so you can control what is being added to your program, and you can choose when it gets updated too. maybe the work youre doing conflicts  the commits done online.

->Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are completely online, done totally on github itself, again making cloning another repository easier, while giving the due credit to the original author.

clones are used to download the forked repo onto to your local machine.

braching is local to a distinct repo, somewhat analogous to forking but inside one repo.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so that you know what commits are i nyour system and what is online. which makes it easier for you to merge and update your files.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
definitely harder without github or git. without both of these amazing tools , collaborating with others will be extremly painfull and very inefficient. 
on the other hand, with these tools we can pretty much collaborate with a bunch of people without any problems.
